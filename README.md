# SPA-practice
Welcome to the official repository for the Single Page Applications (SPA) class at our faculty. This repository serves as a centralized hub for all the code and programs related to the SPA course. Feel free to explore and utilize the resources provided here to enhance your learning experience.

### Linked list
  
<p align="justify">
There are some implementations of linked list. A linked list is a linear data structure used in computer science for organizing and storing data. Unlike arrays, which use contiguous memory locations to store elements, linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.

### List
  
<p align="justify">
The C++ code defines a templated list class. It includes a constant representing a special value, a fixed-size array to store elements, and various methods for list operations such as insertion, deletion, retrieval, and navigation. The class supports dynamic element types and has a maximum list size defined by MAXL. The lambda constant is used to represent a special condition, and the class provides basic functionality for managing and manipulating a linear list of elements.

### Queue

<p align="justify">
Queue is a data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. Imagine a queue in a physical sense, like people waiting in a line; the person who arrives first will be the first to proceed.
</p>

### Stack

<p align="justify">
A stack is a fundamental data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Think of a stack as a collection of items where items are added and removed from the same end, known as the "top" of the stack.

### Binary tree

<p align="justify">
A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in computer science composed of nodes, where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root. Nodes with no children are called leaves.
</p>

### General tree

<p align="justify">
A general tree, also known simply as a "tree" (without any specific adjective like "binary"), is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes. In a general tree, each node can have any number of children, and there is no restriction on the number of children a node can have. This is in contrast to binary trees, where each node can have at most two children.
